# Know Your Agent — RazorCart + Sentinel

**Sentinel is the protection layer between the AI agent and the payment gateway—allowing an AI buying agent to shop intelligently without being trusted blindly.**

RazorCart and Sentinel are two independent applications built for the Razorpay AI Buildathon. RazorCart helps a shopper discover and choose products. Sentinel decides whether the selected buying agent is actually allowed to make the purchase.

The central idea is simple: **AI can recommend an action, but authority must be verified before money moves.**

## The problem

AI agents are becoming good at understanding requests such as “find me a work laptop under ₹50,000.” The difficult question comes next: should that agent be allowed to spend the user’s money?

A useful authorization layer needs to answer questions such as:

- Is this the agent the user originally delegated authority to?
- Is the product from an allowed category and merchant?
- Is the price the same one the user saw?
- Is the purchase inside the total and per-transaction budgets?
- Has this request already been used?
- Has the delegation expired or been revoked?
- Is the request suspicious enough to need human confirmation?

RazorCart and Sentinel solve this by separating the **buying experience** from the **authorization decision**.

## The solution

| Application | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| **RazorCart** | Understand the shopping request, search and rank real products, explain recommendations, manage the cart, and create a signed purchase proposal. |
| **Sentinel** | Authenticate the agent, independently verify the proposal and catalog evidence, enforce delegated limits, return `APPROVE`, `DENY`, or `ESCALATE`, and preserve an audit trail. |

This separation means the storefront cannot quietly grant itself more authority. The same cart can receive different decisions when it is submitted by two agents with different delegations.

## How it works

    end
```

### AI recommends; policy decides

Groq is used for natural-language understanding, product ranking, grounded conversational responses, and bounded risk reasoning. It cannot approve a payment, change a budget, issue a signing credential, or bypass a failed rule.

Budget, category, merchant, expiry, frequency, price-integrity, signature, and replay checks are deterministic. If AI reasoning is unavailable or uncertain, Sentinel fails safely by escalating instead of silently approving.

## What is included

### RazorCart — AI storefront and buying agent

- Conversational shopping assistant with multi-turn context
- Structured intent parsing for category, budget, attributes, and use case
- Database pre-filtering followed by Groq relevance ranking
- Explanations grounded only in stored product fields
- Clarifying questions for ambiguous requests
- Smart closest-alternative responses when no exact match exists
- Real multi-category catalog and hosted product photography from DummyJSON
- Persistent cart CRUD and totals
- Multiple independently configured buying agents
- Per-agent spending, category, merchant, count, frequency, and expiry limits
- Server-generated purchase proposals; browser prices are never trusted
- Demo controls for tampering, replay, budget breach, and merchant mismatch
- AI-action and authorization audit viewer
- Responsive editorial interface with designed loading, empty, error, and 404 states

### Sentinel — independent authorization service

- HMAC-SHA256 agent authentication over canonical JSON
- Per-agent signing credentials generated server-side and returned only once
- Encrypted signing credentials at rest
- Global request-ID replay protection
- Independent authenticated catalog verification
- Total-budget and per-transaction enforcement
- Transaction-count and rolling-frequency enforcement
- Category and merchant allowlists
- Delegation expiry, policy revision, and revocation checks
- Atomic authorization and budget reservation in PostgreSQL
- `APPROVE`, `DENY`, and `ESCALATE` verdicts with machine-readable reasons
- Short-lived authorization artifacts bound to the exact proposal
- Append-only decision and audit history
- Supabase Auth console with administrator and agent-scoped access
- Razorpay Standard Checkout in Test Mode after Sentinel approval; live credentials are refused

## Demo scenarios

RazorCart contains deliberate demo controls so the safety boundary can be shown live instead of described only in slides.

| Scenario | What RazorCart sends | Expected Sentinel behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Normal** | The proposal exactly as shown to the shopper | Approve when every delegated rule passes |
| **Price tampering** | A price different from the trusted catalog | Deny with a catalog-price mismatch |
| **Replay** | A previously used `request_id` | Deny as a duplicate request |
| **Budget breach** | An amount above the agent’s limit | Deny for exceeding delegated authority |
| **Merchant mismatch** | A merchant outside the allowlist | Deny for merchant scope violation |
| **Cross-agent isolation** | The same cart submitted by two agents | Produce separate decisions from each agent’s limits |
| **Near a safety boundary** | A valid but high-risk request | Escalate for additional confirmation |

## Five-minute demo path

1. Open [RazorCart](https://razorcart.vercel.app) and ask the shopping desk for a product using normal language.
2. Refine the request in a follow-up message to demonstrate conversational context.
3. Add a recommendation to the cart and select an active buying agent.
4. Submit the checkout in **Normal** mode and inspect Sentinel’s verdict and checks.
5. Repeat with **Price tampering**, **Replay**, or **Merchant mismatch**.
6. Switch to an agent with a smaller budget or narrower category scope and retry the same cart.
7. Open [Sentinel](https://sentinel-sentinel-a860.vercel.app) to inspect the agent registry, decision feed, and audit trail.

The Sentinel operations console requires a confirmed Supabase Auth account. Administrator access is assigned through protected `app_metadata`; administrator credentials are intentionally not stored in this repository.

## Purchase proposal contract

RazorCart generates a fresh server-side proposal for each purchase attempt. A simplified example is shown below:

```json
{
  "request_id": "req_88213",
  "agent_id": "razorcart-buyer-01",
  "merchant": "razorcart-demo-store",
  "product_name": "Example Laptop",
  "sku": "LAP-EXAMPLE-01",
  "quantity": 1,
  "price": 42999,
  "currency": "INR",
  "category": "laptops",
  "delivery_address": "Redacted before audit storage"
}
```

Sentinel does not treat product names, prices, or merchant claims in this object as trusted evidence. It fetches the matching catalog record independently before authorizing the request.

The applications use separate `razorcart` and `sentinel` PostgreSQL schemas. Sentinel’s authorization tables are not exposed through the browser-facing Supabase Data API.

## Run locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 or newer
- A Supabase project with PostgreSQL and email/password Auth enabled
- A Groq API key for live AI behavior
- Optional Razorpay **test** credentials if testing the payment adapter

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RashiKumar/Know-Your-Agent.git
cd Know-Your-Agent
```

### 2. Collect the Supabase settings

From the Supabase project, collect:

- Transaction-pooler connection URL on port `6543`
- Session/direct connection URL on port `5432`
- Project URL
- Publishable key

Use URL-encoded database passwords. Configure the RazorCart URLs with `schema=razorcart` and Sentinel URLs with `schema=sentinel`. Never place database URLs or server secrets in frontend variables.

Add the local and deployed Sentinel origins to the Supabase Auth redirect allowlist. For local development, include `http://127.0.0.1:5175`.

### 3. Configure Sentinel

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd sentinel
npm install
```

Create an ignored `sentinel/.env.local` containing the database connection URLs and public Supabase settings. Add `GROQ_API_KEY` there or to the private `sentinel/.env` generated by setup.

Required configuration names:

```env
DATABASE_URL="<SENTINEL_TRANSACTION_POOLER_URL>"
DIRECT_URL="<SENTINEL_SESSION_OR_DIRECT_URL>"
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="<SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL>"
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="<SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>"
GROQ_API_KEY="<GROQ_API_KEY>"
```

Then generate private signing credentials and apply the Sentinel migrations:

```bash
npm run setup
```

`npm run setup` creates private random signing, registration, and catalog credentials when they do not already exist. It never prints those credentials.

### 4. Configure RazorCart

In a second terminal:

```bash
cd razorcart
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_URL`, and `GROQ_API_KEY` in the private `razorcart/.env`. Both database URLs must target the RazorCart schema.

Connect the local services without copying credentials by hand:

```bash
cd ../sentinel
npm run connect:razorcart
```

Apply the RazorCart migration and seed the catalog:

```bash
cd ../razorcart
npm run db:setup
```

The seed script discovers and imports the current DummyJSON catalog in pages, validates every product, and keeps the last successful catalog if the upstream API is temporarily unavailable.

### 5. Start both applications

Terminal 1:

```bash
cd sentinel
npm run dev
```

Terminal 2:

```bash
cd razorcart
npm run sentinel:sync
npm run dev
```

Local addresses:

- RazorCart UI: `http://127.0.0.1:5174`
- RazorCart API: `http://127.0.0.1:3002`
- Sentinel console: `http://127.0.0.1:5175`
- Sentinel API: `http://127.0.0.1:3003`

## Environment-variable guide

Only variable names and their purposes are documented here. Real values must stay in ignored local files or encrypted deployment settings.

### RazorCart

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Supabase transaction-pooler URL for the RazorCart schema |
| `DIRECT_URL` | Direct/session database URL for migrations and seeding |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Server-only Groq credential |
| `GROQ_MODEL` | Configurable Groq model name |
| `SENTINEL_URL` | Sentinel authorization endpoint; blank uses the local mock |
| `SENTINEL_REGISTRATION_KEY` | Server-only privileged registration credential |
| `SENTINEL_CATALOG_KEY` | Shared server credential for catalog evidence |
| `RAZORCART_ADMIN_KEY` | Protects RazorCart’s delegation-management route |
| `SENTINEL_CREDENTIAL_KEY` | Encrypts agent signing credentials stored by RazorCart |
| `VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` | Public Razorpay Test Mode key ID used to open Checkout |
| `DEMO_MODE` | Enables clearly labelled corruption controls |

### Sentinel

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Supabase transaction-pooler URL for the Sentinel schema |
| `DIRECT_URL` | Direct/session database URL for migrations |
| `SIGNING_SECRET` | Encrypts and signs Sentinel-issued artifacts |
| `REGISTRATION_API_KEY` | Protects server-to-server agent registration |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Public Supabase project URL used by Auth |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Public Supabase browser key used by Auth |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Server-only Groq credential for risk reasoning |
| `RAZORCART_CATALOG_URL` | Trusted merchant catalog-evidence endpoint |
| `SENTINEL_CATALOG_KEY` | Authenticates catalog-evidence requests |
| `PAYMENT_MODE` | `mock` by default; `test` enables Razorpay Test Mode |
| `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` | Optional Razorpay test key ID |
| `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` | Optional server-only Razorpay test secret |
| `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Webhook-verification secret; required to reconcile captured Test Mode payments |

## Security design

1. **The browser is not trusted.** Catalog prices and authorization totals are reconstructed or verified server-side.
2. **Each agent has its own authority.** Budgets and scopes belong to an agent delegation, not to the storefront globally.
3. **Every request is signed.** Sentinel authenticates the exact canonical proposal before evaluating it.
4. **Replay protection is global.** A request ID is claimed atomically and cannot be reused by another agent.
5. **Catalog evidence is independent.** Sentinel fetches the merchant’s record through an authenticated server-to-server route.
6. **Hard rules are deterministic.** An LLM cannot override a failed signature, budget, scope, expiry, or replay check.
7. **Authorization is transactional.** Sentinel re-checks policy while holding the owning agent’s database row lock before reserving budget.
8. **Artifacts are narrowly bound.** An approval artifact is short-lived, single-use, and tied to the exact agent, merchant, items, amount, and policy revision.
9. **Secrets stay server-side.** Groq, database, registration, signing, and payment credentials never enter the Vite client bundle.
10. **Console access is scoped.** Administrators can inspect all agents; standard users can only inspect their assigned agent.

## Verification

Run each project’s checks independently:

```bash
cd razorcart
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build

cd ../sentinel
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Sentinel’s PostgreSQL integration tests require a dedicated non-production `TEST_DATABASE_URL`:

```bash
cd sentinel
npm run test:integration
```

The integration suite creates an isolated temporary schema and removes only that generated schema after the run.

## Deployment

Both applications include Vercel configuration and are deployed separately:

- [RazorCart production deployment](https://razorcart.vercel.app)
- [Sentinel production deployment](https://sentinel-sentinel-a860.vercel.app)

Production deployment requires the same server-only environment variables in the corresponding Vercel project. Database migrations and catalog seeding must be run against Supabase before deployment. Secrets must never be committed to Git.

For end-to-end Razorpay Test Mode settlement, add a Razorpay Dashboard webhook for `payment.captured` and `payment.failed` at `https://sentinel-sentinel-a860.vercel.app/webhooks/razorpay`. Store the same webhook secret in Sentinel as `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, then redeploy Sentinel. RazorCart's checkout success callback is verified server-side, but the webhook is the independent confirmation that turns a reserved authorization into settled spend.

## Current scope

- Payment mode is `mock` by default.
- Razorpay integration is restricted to Test Mode; live key IDs are rejected.
- No real payment credentials or administrator credentials are included.
- The project demonstrates authorization, tamper detection, isolation, auditability, and a safe payment-provider boundary; it is not presented as a licensed production payment processor.
